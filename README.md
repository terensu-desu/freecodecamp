# My FreeCodeCamp Challenge Collection

I code almost every single day, but since a lot of the resources I work on are all over the internet, not everything gets committed on here. So I'm starting to consolidate everything to GitHub to show what I've done.

As of today, January 28th, FreeCodeCamp has disabled viewing user solutions until the newest version of their website releases. Until then I'll be only uploading my project challenges (which are also viewable on my CodePen: https://codepen.io/terensu-desu).
